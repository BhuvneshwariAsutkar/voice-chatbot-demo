Check the [full list of referrals](https://www.bupa.co.uk/health/health-insurance/medical-referrals) we accept online.",
What is a claim?,"A claim is something we set up for you once we've received a bill for any pre-authorised  treatment you’ve had.

We'll pay the bill and let you know if there's anything you need to pay.",
How do I make a claim?,"So you can focus on getting help for your health, we don’t ask you to set up a claim. 

You’ll book your appointments and we’ll take care of processing your claim once you’ve had treatment.

### How it works ###
1. Book your first appointment, usually this is with a GP. [Check if you need to speak to one first](app://faqDetails/A5860D3E35B9483387D94B967676317B).
2. You’re referred to see a specialist or for tests if you need them.
3. We’ll either get your referral direct from a Bupa digital GP, or if you got a referral elsewhere, you can request treatment. 
4. We’ll check if you’re covered and give you a pre-authorisation number.
5. We'll send you a list of specialists or places to have tests or treatment. Choose one and contact them to make your appointment.
6. Once you’ve had a consultation, tests or treatment, we’ll set up your claim.
7. We’ll get sent an invoice from the specialist or place you visited. We'll pay them and let you know if there's anything you need to pay.",
What counts as a claim?,"A claim is only made when you’ve had pre-authorised consultation, tests or treatment.

### Not counted as a claim: ###
- Bupa digital appointments
- Anytime HealthLine
- Family Mental HealthLine
- [Direct Access](https://www.bupa.co.uk/health/health-insurance/speak-to-a-specialist) appointments

### Claim examples: ###
- Consultations with a specialist
- Scans, blood tests or X-rays
- Procedures such as injections or surgery
- Physio sessions
- Therapy sessions
- Cancer care
- Cash benefits, such as NHS or optical",
Where can I find my claim invoice?,"From your My Bupa home screen, go to ‘Claims’. 

Here you’ll see how much Bupa has paid and how much you need to pay, if anything.",
Why have I been asked to pay?,"There are three possible reasons:

### Excess ###
Many people have an excess. This is the amount you’ll be asked to contribute towards tests, consultations or treatment within a year. 

[How to check your excess](app://faqDetails/41A4D9A44CA74E3B8905A858C36FDBEB)

### Co-pay ### 
Some people who get cover through work have a co-pay. This is when you pay a percentage of your treatment cost, up to a total amount each year.
 
[How co-pay works](app://faqDetails/65B6A9B9134B4209A932039F135813BC)

### Benefit allowance ###
Some people have a benefit allowance. This means there’s a cap on how much Bupa will pay in a year for different types of treatment. Not every treatment has an allowance. 

### An example: ###

Consultations - paid in full. This means there’s no benefit allowance. 

Outpatient therapy, such as physio – up to £500. This means there is a benefit allowance. If it costs more, you’ll be asked to pay the rest.

[How to check your benefit allowance](app://faqDetails/EE348F7B211D498A93681A55F1BE1D56)",
Why is the app still showing I need to pay a claim after I’ve paid?,"When we say ‘You pay’ in the claims area of the app, this is to show your contribution amount. It’s not a demand for payment. 

Because you pay the health facility or consultant directly, only they will follow up with you if payment hasn’t been made. 

If you’ve already paid, there’s nothing left for you to do.",
What’s my excess?,"Your excess total is listed in your certificate. 

To find this document, go into My Bupa and scroll down on the home screen. 

You’ll see an option labelled ‘Documents’. From here, you can view or download your certificate. 

You may see ‘co-pay’ instead of excess if you get cover through work, which works in a similar way to excess.

### If you are on someone else’s cover: ###
To check your excess total, you’ll need to ask them to look on their account for you.",
What is co-pay?,"Co-pay is when you pay a percentage of your treatment cost, up to a total amount each year. 

### For example: ###
10% co-pay. Max £100 in a year.

That means if you have a consultation that costs £200, you’ll pay 10%, which is £20. 

£100 max total - £20 co-pay = £80 left. 

When you next have to contribute to treatment costs, it will be no more than £80.

### Check if you have a co-pay ###
Go to your My Bupa home screen and scroll down. Next, choose ‘Documents’. 

From here, you can view or download your  certificate which will include details of a co-pay, if you have one.

If you’re on someone else’s cover, you’ll need to ask them to look on their account for you.",
How do I pay my excess or co-pay?,"You’ll never pay Bupa directly. We’ll advise you on how to pay the consultant or facility. 

### How it works ###
1. We’ll set up a ‘claim’, which is our way of documenting any authorised tests or treatment you’ve had. 
2. You’ll get a notification to view your new claim in My Bupa. 
3. From your My Bupa home screen, go to ‘Claims’. Here you’ll see how much Bupa have paid and how much you need to pay, if any. 
4. Select your latest claim and scroll to the bottom. Attached will be a claims advice document detailing how to contact your consultant or the facility to pay your excess or co-pay. ",
Do I need to pay for consultations?,"Sometimes. It depends on your type of cover and if you have a benefit allowance, excess or co-pay.

### If you have a benefit allowance ###
This is how much you’re covered for in a year for different types of consultations or treatment.

### If you have any excess left ###
You’ll need to pay this towards your consultation cost. We’ll pay the rest up to your benefit allowance.

### If you have no excess ###
We’ll cover the full cost of your consultation up to your benefit allowance.

### If your cover renewal date is coming up ###
When renewing, your excess resets. This happens on the same date you got your cover. 

If your consultation takes place after renewal, you’ll be asked to pay your excess again. This may cover all or some of the costs of your consultation. If it only covers part, we’ll pay the rest up to your benefit allowance.

### If you have a co-pay ###
This is when you pay a percentage of your treatment cost, up to a total amount each year. We’ll pay the rest up to your benefit allowance.

### Important information ###
Checking your documents can help you understand your cover more. 

For example, if your cover includes a set number of consultations within six months, we’ll tell you.

These may be different depending on where you live. 

### An example ###
Your NHS dentist gives you a filling. Under NHS prices, this would be a ‘Band 2’ treatment, costing £75.30 in England.

To claim, you’d split your treatment this way: 

- £27.40 for ‘preventative treatment’ which is for your dental examination.
- £47.90 for the filling. 

£27.40 + £47.90 = £75.30 paid back to you.",
