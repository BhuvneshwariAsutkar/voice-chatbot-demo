This means there's a cap on how much Bupa will pay in a year for different types of treatment. Not every treatment has an allowance. \n\n### An example: ###\n\nConsultations - paid in full. This means there's no benefit allowance. \n\nOutpatient therapy, such as physio \x96 up to £500. This means there is a benefit allowance.

}, {
    'question': `Why is the app still showing I need to pay a claim after I've paid?`,
    'answer': `When we say 'You pay' in the claims area of the app, this is to show your contribution amount. It's not a demand for payment. \n\nBecause you pay the health facility or consultant directly, only they will follow up with you if payment hasn't been made. \n\nIf you've already paid, there's nothing left for you to do.`
}, {
    'question': `What's my excess?`,
    'answer': `Your excess total is listed in your certificate. \n\nTo find this document, go into My Bupa and scroll down on the home screen. \n\nYou'll see an option labelled 'Documents'. From here, you can view or download your certificate. \n\nYou may see 'co-pay' instead of excess if you get cover through work, which works in a similar way to excess.\n\n### If you are on someone else's cover: ###\nTo check your excess total, you'll need to ask them to look on their account for you.`
}, {
    'question': `What is co-pay?`,
    'answer': `Co-pay is when you pay a percentage of your treatment cost, up to a total amount each year. \n\n### For example: ###\n10% co-pay. Max £100 in a year.\n\nThat means if you have a consultation that costs £200, you'll pay 10%, which is £20. \n\n£100 max total - £20 co-pay = £80 left. \n\nWhen you next have to contribute to treatment costs, it will be no more than £80.\n\n### Check if you have a co-pay ###\nGo to your My Bupa home screen and scroll down. Next, choose 'Documents'. \n\nFrom here, you can view or download your  certificate which will include details of a co-pay, if you have one.\n\nIf you're on someone else's cover, you'll need to ask them to look on their account for you.`
}, {
    'question': `How do I pay my excess or co-pay?`,
    'answer': `You'll never pay Bupa directly. We'll advise you on how to pay the consultant or facility. \n\n### How it works ###\n1. We'll set up a 'claim', which is our way of documenting any authorised tests or treatment you've had. \n2. You'll get a notification to view your new claim in My Bupa. \n3. From your My Bupa home screen, go to 'Claims'. Here you'll see how much Bupa have paid and how much you need to pay, if any. \n4. Select your latest claim and scroll to the bottom. Attached will be a claims advice document detailing how to contact your consultant or the facility to pay your excess or co-pay. `
}, {
    'question': `Do I need to pay for consultations?`,
    'answer': `Sometimes. It depends on your type of cover and if you have a benefit allowance, excess or co-pay.\n\n### If you have a benefit allowance ###\nThis is how much you're covered for in a year for different types of consultations or treatment.\n\n### If you have any excess left ###\nYou'll need to pay this towards your consultation cost. We'll pay the rest up to your benefit allowance.\n\n### If you have no excess ###\nWe'll cover the full cost of your consultation up to your benefit allowance.\n\n### If your cover renewal date is coming up ###\nWhen renewing, your excess resets. This happens on the same date you got your cover. \n\nIf your consultation takes place after renewal, you'll be asked to pay your excess again. This may cover all or some of the costs of your consultation. If it only covers part, we'll pay the rest up to your benefit allowance.\n\n### If you have a co-pay ###\nThis is when you pay a percentage of your treatment cost, up to a total amount each year. We'll pay the rest up to your benefit allowance.\n\n### Important information ###\nChecking your documents can help you understand your cover more. \n\nFor example, if your cover includes a set number of consultations within six months, we'll tell you. \n\nTo find your documents, go to your My Bupa home screen and scroll down.
